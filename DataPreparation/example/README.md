place in Italy.

As a reference in the sector, the sales representatives of your company
attend trade fairs and events to attract new companies that **might want to join their network** of
partners and thus meet the growing market needs.

The Government, once a year organizes a fair, in which the 
companies in the tourisms sector can participate and show their services.

You attended the fair with the aim of reaching out to companies in the sector.

After the event, the sales representatives carried out a research study with contact details of
- potential companies of interest 
- sent you the study and the research dataset obtained 

**Goal**: to prepare contact campaigns and offer them your companyâ€™s services
 and **improve the quality of the dataset** sent to you by the sales representatives

**How**: by applying the necessary 
- data cleansing
- wrangling and
- enrichment techniques 

so that, once clean, they can be integrated into the Corporate CRM system and a

In other words, to obtain clean and normalized data for integration into the
corporate CRM.

The first transform to be carried out is to leave only the meaningful information,
deleting the columns that don't interest us.
