## Automated Reasoning and Search


**Reasoning** (ragionamento):
The ability to solve problems, draw conclusions, learn from the facts, 
establish casual and logical connections between the facts.

Features common to all symbolic AI:
 - **Conceptual model**: using symbols, it can describe the different problems 
that can be described by the system. Problem, operations and solutions are represented.
 - **High level language** representation to describe the problem in a general way
 - **A general porpoise algorythm**, that should find the solution

We have **two families** of algorythm and techniques:
1) Automatic reasoning
2) Search based

### Automatic Reasoning 

The area of AI that studies how to create the systems able to "reasoning" in a similar way humans do.
They are **expert systems**.
It was in the 1970 that A system to diagnoses the infectios of the blood was 
developed: it generated solutions based
on personal information of the patient.
The system applied an inference system of 500 rules.

Also here we have:
1) a **Conceptual model**, defined by a group of experts
2) The **High Level Language** (the First-Order preposition logic)
3) The **Inference Mechanism** : the algorythm to solve the problem based on the conceptual model.

Depending on how this type of information is defined, it is possible
to define different models of reasoning:

#### Reasoning based on Rules
#### Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)
#### Based on Bayesian inference
#### Fuzzy Recognition
#### Other types
