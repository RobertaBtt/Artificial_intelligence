The ability to solve problems, draw conclusions, learn from the facts, 
establish casual and logical connections between the facts.

Features common to all symbolic AI:
 - **Conceptual model**: using symbols, it can describe the different problems 
that can be described by the system. Problem, operations and solutions are represented.
 - **High level language** representation to describe the problem in a general way
 - **A general porpoise algorythm**, that should find the solution

We have **two families** of algorythm and techniques:
1) automatic reasoning
2) search based
